{{< lead >}}
An asynchronous-first virtual conference for the Bayesian community
{{< /lead >}}

We believe that the PyMC project is more than just a codebase. It is also a community that is interested not only in statistical methods and code, but also in sharing knowledge and helping others - whether they be Bayesian veterans or new to the world of open source. The purpose of this conference is to better our community, just as we better our code .

THE GOALS OF THE CONFERENCE ARE TO:

Create a space and time for community members to meet each other and interact

Record and organize the expertise and experience around PyMC

Help folks find ways to contribute to PyMC, authentic to themselves

PYMCON IS A TOTALLY VOLUNTEER RUN CONFERENCE WITH HELP FROM PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
